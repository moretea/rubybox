# RubyBox
__A sandbox for Ruby, which allows execution of untrusted code__

Don't use it. It's not yet ready for production.

# Wanna help?
1. [Fork][0] RubyBox
2. Create a feature branch - `git checkout -b feature/my_branch`
3. Write your fix, _with specs_. (I won't accept non-tested code)
3. Push to your branch -`git push origin feature/my_branch`
4. Create an [Issue][1] with a link to your branch
5. That's it!
